    A core competency in modern programming is understanding a frameworks
    ability to accept, process, and store data in the application which advances
    the user experience. All advice is temporal, although you can find many
    methods and means to organizing an efficient User Experience (UX) with
    vanilla JavaScript, adding in a framework can enhance that capability * 10.
  </p>
  <p>
    Working through modern JavaScript frameworks enables the repetition of
    structured code in the form of components, this is a principal found across
    programming, almost a subtlety that evolves in each language. The idea of a
    component and higher order component seems to have branched from the idea of
    a sub class and a super class.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a super-like fashion we have two data structures, where one falls under
    the next, cascading, where each can have their own functionality
    independently, but share a constant knowledge. The value here is
    simplification of code where by repeating a declaration, allows us to avoid
    repeating lines of code. Observability, maintenance, and overall complexity
    is reduced when forming two constants that have a super class then a sub
    class relationship, sharing data through inheritance.

    Statelessly passing information in React
  </h3>
  <p>
    In <a href="https://react.dev/">React.js</a> there is a core concept called
    <a href="https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component"
      >props or properties</a
    >, these are values which allow us to bind data from one file of code and
    pass it to the next in a one-way model. As you can see in the documentation,
    these props, an enlightened set of attributes that are available from
    upstream to pass downstream in the Virtual
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM"
      >Document Object Model (DOM)</a
    >
    tree.
  </p>
  <p>
    Commonly you will see components split out into separate files, like the
    below code block, which allows for a best practice called
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Code_splitting"
      >code splitting</a
    >, in turn enhancing the application rendering.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-javascript" [innerHTML]="first"></code></pre>
  <p>
    A
    <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef"
      >ref, reference, or useRef hook</a
    >
    provides the ability to consume Virtual DOM events from the given html
    element that it is pointing to. There also exists, a method of referencing
    downstream events, where we pass an event listener in a React.js format to
    the sub class as reference for the super class through props.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-javascript" [innerHTML]="second"></code></pre>
  <p>
    As these two points of the framework exist, props and refs, which allow us
    to add html attributes through React.js and consume events we have selected
    to listen; we can quickly bootstrap a method of creating a small data
    pipeline between higher order and lower level components.

    Statefully passing information in React

  <p>
    In the initial form of React.js there was a more structural configuration
    that required you to move the various components of your classes through a
    lifecycle. A lot of this lifecycle became blended into the hooks library,
    these states or snapshots of the React.js lifecycle, enable the interface to
    interact with the user as they interact with the interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    The
    <a href="https://react.dev/learn/updating-objects-in-state"
      >state or useState hook</a
    >
    enables the capture of data within the current lifecycle of the React.js
    component, when this component is loaded or mounted in the Virtual DOM, and
    until it is no longer rendered, or forcefully reloaded through user action.
    As we know from navigation in the browser, which in classic websites is
    often a page reload then a load of a new file to the DOM, is not so common
    in modern applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    In React.js, we are able to load new components throughout the lifecycle
    without loading the page due to the Virtual DOM without impacting the DOM.
    This virtualization affords us more complexity in the transition of code,
    data, and components. We have to build to emulate this data coupling when
    thinking through the requirements of the system, where components
    needn&#39;t live longer than there data and vice versa.
  </p>
  <p>
    Long story short, all of this new technical freedom lead to libraries for
    state management, which at the time were very complex and elaborate in
    tandem with the previous class and constructor composition. Where this
    became very fickle was managing state between components and all the code it
    would take to share information across the app, assuming this was the
    motivation, <a href="https://danabra.mov/">Dan Abramov</a> and
    <a href="https://andrewclark.io/">Andrew Clark</a> created a library that is
    quite prominent, called <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a>. As big as
    the components were, adding any state management library felt like
    configuring an enterprise network to enable bi-lateral data or two-way
    binding between the various pages and components of the application.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fast-forward to now, you can skip a lot of the clunkier code and use state
    libraries much like the way you can access the lifecycle methods, through
    hooks. The now slimmer and Meta adapted library, which became
    <a href="https://redux-toolkit.js.org/">Redux Toolkit</a>, is a very
    powerful tool for component inheritance, and logic considerations throughout
    the application.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this sense, when applying this package or framework, we incorporate an
    application wide store, which more or less stores data. In the below code
    block, an example of a real world plus/minus example.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-javascript" [innerHTML]="third"></code></pre>
  <p>
    As you can see, this application can in place update the data, while
    rendering it dynamically all without reloading the page, which is a
    quintessential feature of React.js. Through the addition of this library,
    instead of rendering only when the updated component is currently mounted in
    the Virtual DOM, we can use this data throughout the dynamic routing and
    across the application, until it is reloaded or reset. We get to escape the
    <a href="https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects"
      >React Lifecycle</a
    >, even if for the moment which enables us to move further with a few extra
    tools.
  </p>
  <h3 id="consuming-information-in-react-and-stateful-persistence">
    Consuming information in React and stateful persistence
  </h3>
  <p>
    Now that we have unpacked the metaphorical toolbox, we can compose super and
    subclasses, mutate the Virtual DOM, and statefully access the data
    throughout the application. I think it makes sense looking at these as
    pieces, to me &quot;<a
      href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/20103-the-whole-is-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts"
      >The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.</a
    >&quot; is how I have learned quite a lot, I tag these as pieces in my mind,
    and see how they fit together as more.
  </p>
  <p>
    The whole problem statement we are really looking at here is that there
    isn&#39;t quite an obvious way to extract data from a sub class and present
    it to the super class, to take an action in the class without creating a
    blocker. The blocker that evolves here, is that you potentially need to
    access the data from a dynamic number of sub classes into a constant super
    class and respectively attribute the data into one joined output.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the GitHub Gist below, you will see as an example of a login form and a
    submit form, as the sub classes, and a page called logon as the super class.
    These breadcrumbs provide the modularity to enable multiple pages to draw
    from a similar schema and invoke different combinations of outcomes, reusing
    effective logic across them.

    >
  </p>
  <p>
    In the above Gist, the familiar HTML elements for labels, inputs, and the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form"
      >form element</a
    >
    itself are present in the React.js component using
    <a href="https://formik.org/">a package called Formik</a>, which bakes in
    its own lifecycle hooks. The hooks presented by Formik allow for escaping
    the requirements of adding selectors and queries to get the values of the
    form inputs. In the various form elements, we catalyze the Formik object
    values, in a JSON format to pass the values through Redux toolkit, with the
    dispatch method to store the values in the application.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-javascript" [innerHTML]="fifth"></code></pre>

      >All of the form fields are belong to Redux - Consuming information in
      React and stateful persistence - Submit Form</a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    As an independent form, the submit button which triggers the system of forms
    to pass their values to a final function, starts from this sub class and
    involves the other sub class forms, along with the page which aligns as the
    super class.
    <a
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/submit_event"
      >The submit event</a
    >
    is what invokes this sequence of events in a way that enables and serves the
    snapshot of data across forms. Implementing the selector method of Redux
    toolkit to consume the Formik values which are stored on change in the
    application, the submit button has the responsibility of passing the values
    to the super class. As a prop or property based function, which the submit
    button returns the values as a snapshot of the information entered at the
    time the button is clicked.
  </p>
  <pre><code class="lang-javascript" [innerHTML]="sixth"></code></pre>
  <p>
    <a
      href="https://gist.github.com/heyitsjoealongi/0baa6d1a9204de50695338331a71b614"
      >All of the form fields are belong to Redux - Consuming information in
      React and stateful persistence - Logon Page</a
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    On the logon page, we consume the data from the function passed down to the
    submit sub class, and submit that to the auth provider, in this case, we are
    using the
    <a
      href="https://supabase.com/docs/reference/javascript/auth-signinwithpassword"
      >Supabase - Sign in a user API</a
    >
    and platform to provide authentication and authorization. As a result of
    authentication we can allow the user to progress through dynamic routing
    from
    <a href="https://remix.run/docs/en/main/discussion/react-router"
      >Remix - React Router</a
    >
    or stay to re-submit their username and password with notification or
    validation errors.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a final thought, we know that now the ability to join all of this data
    and invoke the submission is possible across multiple components, which
    isn&#39;t inherently possible or obviously configurable in React.js alone.
    The next step for this position is to decide how to persist this data, if
    required when the page is hard reloaded or we change the state of the
    current users client/browser.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are options to install packages like
    <a href="https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist#readme">redux-persist</a>,
    which overtime may not be maintained and support changes across libraries.
    In other scenarios where you need immediate reliability from your own
    confidence, moving these JSON objects into the
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API"
      >Web Storage API</a
    >
    can escape the regular lifecycle of browser navigation. Even further and if
    needed, storing the session in a database for retrieval and update is also
    quite pragmatic and enduring.
