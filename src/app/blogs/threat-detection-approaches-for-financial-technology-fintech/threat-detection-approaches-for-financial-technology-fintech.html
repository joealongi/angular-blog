    Planning for incidents in one of the most secure and regulated industries in
    cyberspace
  </h2>
  <p>
    Jumping back into Cybersecurity Architecture this past week allowed me to
    plan a set of procedures to implement threat detection plan and team for a
    financial institution. As a developer, architect, and technical advisor I
    often advocate for the implementation of secure by default processes,
    infrastructure, and auditing. When it comes to cybersecurity, especially in
    the modern era, not planning for an incident can be an incident in itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    As Financial Technology transaction enumerate in digital volume, the more
    surface area and risk firms will need to manage as a financial services
    provider. When weighing the vulnerabilities, defining the risks, and
    identifying the threats a working policy with incorporated standards will
    stand as a reference for the complex guidelines.

  <p>
    When scaling the infrastructure to support customers and partners in
    financial services, it is important to establish roles and guidelines for
    the event of threats and the business reporting. These roles can be
    identified in many ways with different titles, though as a defined set,
    <a href="https://nordicdefender.com/blog/cyber-security-team-structure"
      >their objectives should all have coverage as the cybersecurity domain
      keeps evolving</a
    >
    and expanding.
  </p>
  <p>
    A security team outside of the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO),
    should take place in all threat detection and reporting. Staff members
    across the incident response team should be split across all events. In each
    incident the Security Operations Center Manager (SOCM) can determine who is
    available for which incidents and when. In the event of incident and
    vulnerability detection, including all regularly scheduled risk assessments,
    the report will be sent and relayed to the CISO.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Security Operations Center - Incident Response - Staffing Roles:</em>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        Chief Information Security Officer (CISO): Managing the information
        security program
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Security Operations Center Manager (SOCM): Managing the SOC and security
        operation
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity Architect: Researching and designing the security
        operation
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity Engineer: Implementing and establishing the security
        operation
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity Analyst: Analyzing threat and risk data about the security
        operation
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As reflected by the roles and hierarchy of the Security Operations Center
    (SOCM), the staffing depicts the requirements of this team to plan,
    engineer, and analyze the security landscape of the security operation. In
    supplement to the staffing roles, some outline of the responsibilities can
    be defined for hiring and sourcing purposes, aligned with this specific
    focus and task of threat detection.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the financial technology organization, the Chief Information Security
    Officer (CISO) oversees information across the business, with the focus of
    securing the operations and effectiveness of the security to support its
    movement across the firm. The CISO will work across business units, and task
    the various security and technology teams with enabling the business to
    securely operate.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a key staff member to the CISO, the Security Operations Center Manager
    (SOCM) oversees the security team that handles day to day operations, they
    manage the team, approvals, and move the staff around within the SOC to
    enable success. As the SOC Manager, they adapt the teams&#39; roster to
    address challenges and prioritize the architects to begin the process of
    addressing current and future threats.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Cybersecurity Architect takes on the planning and provisioning of the
    overall infrastructure and security whether it is services or data
    architecture. The architecture of the services and how they contribute to
    the success of the full operation part of the primary consideration and role
    of the architect, in addition to their research, review of the data and
    emerging threats.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a Cybersecurity Engineer, this staff member will work through the
    implementation of systems with a technical proficiency of code and
    Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The engineer will provide various work
    products that align with developing the system from the ground up, including
    maintenance, triage, and changes requested by the Cybersecurity Architect
    and approved by the SOC Manager.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Cybersecurity Analyst role, staff members in this area will work to
    review the data, they will provide internal team reports, review system
    events, changes, and monitor the system upon change. The analysts are the
    eyes and ears of the team from data in transit to data at rest, making sure
    to turn over every piece of information.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the scale of the security landscape increases to a scale that demands
    more team members, the SOCM and CISO will find the operational requirement
    and work with the financial institutions administration to increase the
    staffing.

  <h3 id="detection-and-reporting-across-the-network-layers">
    Detection and reporting across the network layers
  </h3>
  <p>
    In the daily fluctuation of data, security, and network traffic it is
    important to create policies leading into the future that include threat
    detection steps. Proactive threat detection, investigation of threats and
    anomalies, remediation and response activities, and recovery of corrupted
    assets are some of the general objectives that the Security Operations
    Center (SOC) should be prepared to handle.
  </p>
  <p>
    These standards are subject to change in addition to their implementation
    and meaning to be reshaped as technology advances. Through this detection
    plan, specific strategies may be employed for each of these major categories
    and will be outlined accordingly.
  </p>
  <h5 id="proactive-threat-detection">Proactive Threat Detection</h5>
  <p>
    A real-time approach to analyzing, detecting, and mitigating risk begins by
    enabling proactive threat hunting measures available through
    <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-sentinel/"
      >Microsoft Sentinel</a
    >. In a highly secure cloud environment, Microsoft Sentinel will scale
    security coverage with cloud flexibility, allowing monitoring and event
    management to scale in throughput to match active Microsoft Azure Cloud
    resources.
  </p>
  <p>
    A
    <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-siem"
      >Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</a
    >, solution is a powerful monitoring tool that can adaptively scan and
    monitor data flowing through the network. Detecting and evaluating threats
    in the landscape of network traffic that will be automated and enhanced by
    Artificial Intelligence (AI), trained on Threat Intelligence (TI). The
    reference set of data based on historical threats and advisories, enables
    the SIEM tool to investigate and validate threats, followed by reporting
    back to the security team for further investigation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Information across the network, sent across devices endpoints, and processed
    through the web services can be monitored through
    <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint"
      >Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) with Microsoft Defender</a
    >
    for Endpoint. Microsoft Defender for Business will fortify the network,
    devices, and empower the services to move at machine speed while
    establishing secure devices end to end.
  </p>
  <h5 id="investigation-of-threats-and-anomalies">
    Investigation of Threats and Anomalies
  </h5>
  <p>
    When identified threats are forwarded to a Single Pane of Glass (SPOG) view
    with the Microsoft SIEM technologies, they are available for review by the
    security team which can handled escalation and remediation. The Microsoft
    Sentinel platform can enable automation and orchestration through playbooks,
    to create a
    <a
      href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/automation/automate-responses-with-playbooks"
      >Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) framework that
      assists the security team</a
    >
    in validating threats and risks.
  </p>
  <p>
    In evaluating the events occurring within the system, Microsoft Sentinel
    provides integrations through playbooks for further enhancement of data, by
    enriching incidents with Virus Total to use Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
    about reference-able similar incidents. These enhanced incidents can be
    forwarded to an events channel in Microsoft Teams, where the security team
    can further review and prioritize event information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Monitoring of user escalation and access anomalies through the lens of
    Conditional Access will be identified and
    <a
      href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/overview-identity-protection"
      >auto remediated by way of Microsoft Entra ID Protection</a
    >, this is passed in with the integration to Microsoft Sentinel.
    Communication channels used for security operations can also
    <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-office-365"
      >automate the protection of collaboration tools by actively monitoring
      with AI-powered defense</a
    >
    that can detect phishing and scam communications.
  </p>
  <h5 id="remediation-and-response-activities">
    Remediation and Response Activities
  </h5>
  <p>
    Through the automation of Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Defender for
    Business, and Microsoft Entra ID, the security team can establish support
    from an actively scanning, remediating and escalating system. In a
    task-driven process the security team can perform weekly prioritization of
    the affected services, applications, and critical Information Technology
    (IT) infrastructure issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the threats are beyond automated remediation,
    <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-vulnerability-management#tabxe8fdee3e603241fcaf114ca8d9929b1a"
      >the weekly tasks and scheduled maintenance should follow a prioritization
      provided through the Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management</a
    >
    dashboard. The security team can follow the provided security
    recommendations to focus on cyberthreats that pose the highest risk and
    forecast their remediation in line with other events identified in the SIEM.
  </p>
  <h5 id="recovery-of-corrupted-assets">Recovery of Corrupted Assets</h5>
  <p>
    If information and systems become compromised by a vulnerability that was
    unknown prior to an attack or incident, the security team can work to
    identify the threat, remediate the risk, and recover the system to restore
    and protect data.
  </p>
  <p>
    The security team can work through the SIEM and SOAR utilities provided by
    Microsoft Sentinel and Microsoft Defender for Business, these Software as a
    Service (SaaS) platform will contain the information and research tools to
    gain the insight to remediate vulnerabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    When working through the remediation process and enhanced security
    definitions provided in Microsoft Teams through automations, the security
    team can build a report around each incident that was not initially
    detected. Through support from Microsoft Security Copilot, the
    <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot"
      >system will summarize vast data signals into key insights to cut through
      the noise</a
    >, and make use of AI-driven guidance and analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    Digital versioning and service backups stored in the Microsoft Azure Cloud
    can be used to collocate and detect data that may have arrived during the
    incident and encapsulate vulnerabilities in containers running at the time.
    If required a snapshot of the database, applications, virtual machines, and
    other cloud storage can be restored once the vulnerabilities are remediated.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the security team identifies the vulnerabilities in the system, their
    reach through security logs, and the general propensity of threat to a
    similar system with OSINT and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)
    references, they can document the affected systems, data, and users in their
    incident report. Through incident reports, general data about the harm and
    depth of these systems, once remediated can be closed and shared in a
    security incident database to continue to model AI and TI threat detection
    mechanisms for future events.
