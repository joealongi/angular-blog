    Working through threat modeling and a secured software development life
    cycle (SSDLC) plan, for Cybersecurity Architecture this past week allowed me
    to describe how SSDLC or
    <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/practices"
      >security development lifecycle (SDL)</a
    >
    can lead to implementing software in a more secure fashion. The frequency of
    data breaches, spoofing, and privilege escalation that occurs day to day has
    increased, seemingly at the rate that software has been developed.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is no shortage of businesses looking to automate and increases their
    daily task offloading to software and automated systems that can reach
    across the globe. In the demand for software engineers and technological
    dependance brought on by consumers, there is also a wide range of coding
    skills, looking to take on the work as a career. If not through in-house,
    learning on the job code work, even if not the low price and speedy delivery
    coders from anywhere, there is still a risk to the most professional coding
    environments and their developers code.

    A future state of mind for a zero-trust model of threats on the horizon
  </h3>
  <p>
    As cybersecurity teams take on the process of advancing applications and
    infrastructure to develop the latest software enhancements, it is important
    to create processes for the team, identified through application and
    industry specific planning sessions. The methods to the approach fits into
    an evolving set of principles that are structured to advance the methods of
    software development. In the ever-changing threat landscape. When developing
    software and information technology every team must prepare for threats from
    the beginning.
  </p>
  <p>
    In an approach to architect infrastructure and harden the software utilized
    by a financial technology firm, the team plans to following SSDLC. SSDLC is
    a framework for developing secure software, a set of processes and
    activities to follow that ensure the software is developed with security in
    mind. The SDDLC framework includes a series of steps as follows ---
    planning, requirements and analysis, design and prototyping, development,
    deployment, and maintenance to validate each procedure along the way.
  </p>
  <p>
    When analysis and preparing a threat model diagram, you can see the various
    actors, the boundaries, and sensitive information stores which provide
    integration and long-term memory to the software for the financial services
    application. The team should plan a series of controls that limits the reach
    of any one user other than administrators of the system, layering the
    infrastructure for defense, while also applying best practices in data
    validation and sanitization for assuring quality information. In this
    consideration, the
    <a
      href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-pci-dss"
      >Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)</a
    >
    requires the team to work with the card vendor to handle inbound request and
    outbound responses for limiting any systems interaction with payment
    information.

        Incorporating least privilege to each of these considerations as a
        zero-trust model for devising customer, employee, manager, and
        administrator privileges can enable a separation of duties. Through a
        divided responsibility matrix,
        <a
          href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility"
          >including the shared responsibility mode</a
        >, the content of the customers is protected. The actions of the
        employees should only visible upon confirmation, and the managers have
        direct access to the system, but indirect access to the data, which is
        the responsibility of the administrators to oversee.

        Infrastructure, layered with boundaries and integrations can segment the
        network, data, and operational activities, leaving it out of reach of
        the public and in most cases, the employees to limit bias or misuse
        through access to Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or Sensitive
        Personally Identifiable Information (SPII). In the
        <a
          href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/securityengineering/sdl/threatmodeling"
          >creation of a threat model</a
        >
        and planning the team can recognized the importance of this data and the
        volume in which this application will intake and store. As a very secure
        and audited industry, it is beneficial to detect intrusions throughout
        the application with layered security. Tools like the
        <a
          href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/develop/threat-modeling-tool"
          >Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool </a

          >OWASP Threat Dragon</a

        will be used to document these considerations and ahead of time
        remediations.

        Enabling data validation and sanitization is integrated through the
        form-based UI components with libraries for informing the user of
        defective information and monitored by intrusion detection systems. The
        form integrations can monitor for
        <a

          >Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks with the addition of the Web
          Application Firewall (WAF)</a
        >
        for SQL injection and dynamic code manipulation. The user-friendly
        libraries that validate form and API payload inputs, also support
        detection of malicious actors, documenting their attempts to disrupt the
        system if they occur.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        In a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance
        consideration, establishing enhanced card data security will facilitate
        adoption of consistent data security measures globally. As customers use
        their financial tools and instruments, their information and data must
        be protected with above board operations and in-depth security. The
        payment card information in addition to the metadata collected with
        transactions could leave a footprint of digital history that in
        nefarious hands could be misused. It is important not only to protect
        the customers financial information, but also their information
        regarding PII/SPII stored for an accurate knowledge of the customer.
        Through risk transference, the financial technology firm reduces their
        vulnerability and attack surface, as their digital services can be
        secured and purchased through a provider to offload the immense security
        requirements of finical data. These measures should be heavily
        considered in the threat model and weighed as opportunities that may
        reduce the overall cost of the platform in the longterm, considering the
        cost of accepted risks that could turn into breaches.
      </p>
    </li>

      <p>
        Firewalls are imperative measures for safekeeping technology and have
        long stood as an infrastructural outer layer. From the WAF firewall that
        protects from scripting and injection to unidentified vulnerabilities,
        to the virtual private network blocks and port detection for various
        services that may be integrated into the digital campus platform. There
        are a series of configurations that work as allow lists across different
        boundaries, which can be documented in the threat model and planned to
        restrict illicit access and support the containerized application in
        sustaining services. As requests from the UI enter through the
        application load balancers (ALBs) they are filtered at the web server
        and WAF, down to the security protocols, monitoring the packets that
        flow through each port by request. These subtitles are what enables a
        platform to remain secure and mitigate the attack surface of the
        University&#39;s digital campus.

          identity services</a
        >
        with enhanced multi-factor authentication security. Customers accessing
        their financial services, can be protected, sometimes even restricted
        conditionally if there is variance in their normal baseline practices,
        such as location, device, and method that can be abnormal and require
        more validation for security.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p><em>Incorporating the threat model and analysis in the SSDLC:</em></p>
  <p>
    While in the planning phase of the SSDLC the team should work though the
    various user identities, the core users such as the customers, employees,
    managers, and administrators that would use the platform. The processes of
    the team should identify the high-fidelity flows in Authentication,
    Accounts, Transactions, and Customer Navigation, as
    <a
      href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-test-user-flows"
      >these common user flows are the building blocks for the application</a
    >
    and will often be replicated in nuance. The high regard of the information
    and the financial services firm&#39;s, reputation should influence
    considerations on increased separation across the application layers and
    services with responsibilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    When working on requirements and analysis, the team should scope the
    application to take the least number of steps across each interaction so
    that they
    <a
      href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/container-secure-supply-chain/articles/container-secure-supply-chain-implementation/observability-overview"
      >can structure actions in universal ways for performance and security
      observability</a
    >. The threat model evolves at this point as the team can opt to transfer
    risk, in example, to the payment provider and the identity provider,
    reducing the internal and direct data store of critical application
    information. These steps and processes as providing a very resilient and
    scalable application by creating repeatable and durable processes that store
    their dependencies outside of the code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Through the design and prototype phase the team can look at methods of error
    handling that obfuscated critical system information and increased the user
    experience (UX). They can also introduced the libraries after testing the
    forms and wiring up the WAF to monitor its effectiveness for de-risking the
    customer inputs. Through development the software development team can
    create unit tests for the happy and unhappy paths of each component as they
    build onto an individually auditable component library. In the accessibility
    tools, and in favor of accessibility they should build out wizard type
    automations that reduce complexity and incomplete data, while simplifying
    form entry, and spoofing, with locked down or pre-filled fields. The
    software should also written on meticulously established computer systems
    with monitoring that reduces the ability of any developer or employee of
    from becoming an insider threat.
  </p>
  <p>
    When deploying the software the development,
    <a
      href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-devsecops"
      >security and operations (DevSecOps) should follow best practices</a
    >
    in applying code linting, vulnerability scanning, and automated testing to
    assure the quality of the code moving to the environment. As this team plans
    for the customers base to fluctuate around the clock, they should focus on
    scaled infrastructure that will allow for cost savings and high-demand,
    whenever needed. Tools like
    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops/"
      >Azure DevOps</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/monitor/"
      >Azure Monitor</a
    >
    allow for CI/CD and analytics for reviewing the infrastructure and resources
    to continuously monitor the SSDLC&#39;s planning effectiveness.
  </p>
  <p>
    For maintenance and lifespan, the components, software, designs, and
    infrastructure should be tagged, documented, and labeled for quickly
    referencing and identifying the source of the issues. Through a verbose
    logging platform, on going monitoring, and incident tracking any team
    performing the maintenance will have a clearly identified cause to begin
    analyzing and repairing the system.
