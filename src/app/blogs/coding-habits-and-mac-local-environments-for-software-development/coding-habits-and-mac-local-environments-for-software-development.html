    You may have recently unboxed a new laptop, you may have recently reset an
    old one, all still the same, for some reason you are here and wondering what
    it is you can do, hopefully to setup your local development environment. All
    advice is temporal, if you are a first time dev, looking to get started, or
    a long time dev looking for tips, all of this is one frame of reference, so
    you should take it as that, one view of a good start.

    There are many opinionated defaults I have accumulated over the years, and

    find different languages, patterns, tools, and syntax a way that is
    different than others and similar to some, and that is sort of what leads
    you to your focus.

    Although Safari and the Apple privacy features pack a powerful solution, it
    is important to realize the value of independent security features. Brave
