# Compendium of bitwise nomenclature from applications to cybersecurity

## Words in cyberspace, writings on the IDE, and plans in Agile board

Throughout time we have encapsulated the moment in pictograms, symbols, words, and in modern terms, blogging. Working to explain with contextual evaluation of terms, as we capture outcomes in a sense of structure, to be repeated in daily use, and eventually proliferated through media.

As these words gain affinity, they will find their way into headlines, biopics, shows, movies, and transcend time as the cyberspace evolves. Creating a compendium summarizes nuance and regard to juxtapose the future era references and changing patterns of use that may derive from them.

All advice is temporal, as architecture becomes infrastructure and sprints become code, words fixed to tasks can only heighten the awareness of the outcome. The words may change and meanings may evolve, though this snapshot of history will endure as a reminder of what was now.
